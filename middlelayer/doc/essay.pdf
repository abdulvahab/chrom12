    Explain how you set about the project detailing:
        how you interacted with the other members of the group
        how you (as a group) came up with the requirements for the overall project
        how you (as an individual) came up with the requirements for your contribution
    How well did the development cycle work within the group?
    You should document the development process - what stages did you go through and what steps did you take? Did you go through several iterations or did you spend a long time in design and then a relatively short development stage?
    What strategies (if any) did you take for testing your code - particularly if other people's code wasn't ready?
    Are there any known issues or bugs, or anything that doesn't work as specified?
    You should discuss what worked well and what could have worked better - both with your code and the group interaction. Were there any particular problems? Conversely were there any solutions or ideas that you were particularly proud of?
    Were there alternative strategies you could have used? (Either for the project design or implementation)
    What do you think you gained out of the project? How has this experience helped you? What experience or insights have you gained?

Consequently I suggest headings of the form:

    Approach to the project
        Interaction with the team
        Overall project requirements
        Requirements for my contribution
    Performance of the development cycle
    The development process
    Code testing
    Known issues
    What worked and what didn't - problems and solutions
    Alternative strategies
    Personal insights
